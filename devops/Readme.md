1. Take a simple nodejs server of your choosing, make it installable on kubernetes, then write documentation for a user (in this case, me) to install that server on their own kubernetes.
2. You should assume that the user is technical, but isn't knowledgeable on kubernetes.
3. The user (me), will only install this on their local machine.
4. The documentation does not need to be elaborate, but it should be clear and cover all the steps that the users need to do.
5. Please submit the project as a github repo.

As far as I can tell this shouldn't take too long, please let me know if it's alright!
