## Kyso Front End project

A next.js/react/redux focused take home project for Front-end Developers.

###Â Instructions

- Solution should be responsive
- Use the included json-server.json file to build an API using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server). Read json-server documentation to know how to query the API.
- Make sure you're taking care about performance. If there is something wrong, and you can't solve it in the frontend, explain what's the problem (comments in the code or via email)
- Create a dashboard that shows a list of the reports
- Make sure that all the main data is visible, name, description, owner, preview image etc
- Make sure that you show number of views, number of comments and stars as well
- Allow editing of:
    - name
    - description
    - tags
    - stars
    - views
- the edits do not need to persist through a server restart.
- Make sure to use redux as the store, and use actions and reducers for all the data edits.
- Make sure to allow editing of the reports within the list.
- Ship your project to be easily executable by others (maybe using Docker and Docker Compose)
